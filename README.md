# ML-Competition

[Alex Jurado, Felip Samitier and Carlos Martinez]

[Full-Time Data Analytics Bootcamp, Barcelona March 2021]


## Competition Description
We had a little Machine Learning competition during the bootcamp where we had to predict the quality of cookies. We were given a dataset first thing in the morning and we had a day and a half to work with these dataset to find the best model with the best parameters. The team that had the best prediciton wins.

## Organization and Flow
We started by exploring the data with some visualizations, then cleaning and formatting the dataset in order to scale it and fit the dataset to our models. We tried different models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and Deep Neural Network. Our best prediciton was with the Deep Neural Network model. We also chose to include our Random Forest since our predictions were very similar.
